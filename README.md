Atom (under development) can currently solve stoichiometric problems as well as simple conversions/balancing.



## Existing Commands (WIP)

```python
>stoichiometry Ex. -stoichiometry N2 N2O5 170 20 40 (N)2 + (O)2 = (N)2(O)5 # 340.0 grams of N2O5

>balance Ex. -balance (Fe)1 + (Cl)2 = (Fe)1(Cl)5 # 2Fe + 5Cl2 = 2FeCl5

>ytsearch Ex. -ytsearch Machine Learning verbose=2

>standard conversions 
    > mass-to-moles
    > mass-to-units
    > moles_to_mass
    > moles_to_units
    > units-to-mass
    > units-to-moles

(Params and description can be seen with the "-help" command)
```
